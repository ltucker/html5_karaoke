Javascript Karaoke (CDG+MP3) Player
===================================

This is an experimental but mostly finished javascript/html5 karaoke
player based on the cdg instruction specification by Jim Bumgardner.

Crumby Demo Here: http://ltucker.github.io/html5_karaoke/

Status:

* Haven't tried it in many browsers.  
* Not actively working on this.
* Probably flakey if skipped around?

Also check out [cdgraphics](https://github.com/bhj/cdgraphics), a modern library based on this!
